---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **JITO Bundle Testing:**
   - JITO bundles may not land on devnet (limited support)
   - Mainnet has better bundle success rates
   - If bundle fails, falls back to standard transaction

2. **Anti-Snipe Enforcement:**
   - Launch delays are logged but not enforced on-chain
   - Bot detection is pattern-based (not foolproof)
   - Whitelist management is off-chain (can be bypassed)

3. **Security Scoring:**
   - Scores are subjective and algorithmic
   - Cannot detect all honeypot patterns without live testing
   - Social verification relies on provided links (not verified)

4. **Cost Estimation:**
   - Cost display may not update in real-time
   - JITO tips are not refundable if bundle fails

## üéì User Acceptance Criteria

Before shipping to production, confirm:

- ‚úÖ All UI elements render correctly on desktop and mobile
- ‚úÖ Security scores accurately reflect token configuration
- ‚úÖ MEV protection works on mainnet (test with small amounts)
- ‚úÖ Anti-snipe protection logs are clear and helpful
- ‚úÖ Critical warnings prevent user mistakes
- ‚úÖ Cost estimation includes all fees
- ‚úÖ Success screen displays all relevant data
- ‚úÖ Documentation is complete and accurate
- ‚úÖ No console errors in production build
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable (< 15s total)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: SecurityDashboard doesn't appear
**Solution:** Verify "Enable Security Scan" is checked in Step 4

### Issue: JITO bundle fails
**Solution:** JITO has limited devnet support. Try on mainnet or disable MEV protection for testing.

### Issue: Security score is 0 or incorrect
**Solution:** Ensure all required form fields are filled. Check browser console for errors.

### Issue: "Critical Security Issues" warning won't go away
**Solution:** This is by design. Fix the issues (e.g., reduce transfer fees) or proceed with caution.

### Issue: Token creation fails with security features enabled
**Solution:** Check wallet balance (need extra SOL for JITO tips). Try disabling MEV protection first.
